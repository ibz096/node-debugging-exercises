# Exercise 05

This is a more complicated exercise of fixing broken tests. In `index.js`, I've implemented a function (rather poorly) that merges 2 arrays of objects based on a given `key`. Your job is to refactor the code to make it more readable and fix the bug so that all the tests pass.

To run the tests, you can run `npm run test` or `npm run test:watch` to run in watch mode.
