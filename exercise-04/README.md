# Exercise 04

This exercise contains a basic Express app that fetches some data from a GitHub Gist. There's a bug in the api when you access `/cards/:id` (ex. `/cards/1`). 

Use the debugger to figure out the cause, and refactor the code to fix it.

BONUS: What happens if you access `/cards/4` or `/cards/hello`? How would you handle these cases?
