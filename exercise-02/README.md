# Exercise 02

I've implemented a very basic `add` function that adds two values together. There are two test cases that are passing and two that are failing. I want you to modify the implementation of `add` to make all the test cases pass.

To run the tests, you can run `npm run test` or `npm run test:watch` to run in watch mode.
